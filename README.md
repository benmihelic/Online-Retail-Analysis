# Retail Sales Analysis with SQL and Tableau

---
## Project Overview

This project analyzes an online retail dataset to uncover revenue trends, customer behavior, and sales performance across products and countries. Using **PostgreSQL** for data preparation and **Tableau** for visualization, I created an interactive dashboard highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) and business insights.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:

- Clean and aggregate raw transactional data using **SQL**  
- Build calculated fields and KPIs for decision-making  
- Design a clear, interactive Tableau dashboard for stakeholders

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Dataset:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)  
- **PostgreSQL (psql shell):** data cleaning, joins, aggregation  
- **SQL:** grouping, filtering, creating CSV extracts  
- **Tableau Public:** visualization and dashboard design  
- **GitHub:** project documentation and portfolio publishing  
## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Source
- Dataset: [Online Retail (UCI Machine Learning Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)  
- Raw format: CSV containing invoice-level transactions.

### 2. Data Preparation in PostgreSQL
I used **psql** shell to load the dataset into a PostgreSQL database, then created summary tables/CSVs for Tableau.

I had to reformat the invoicedate column in order to extract just the year and month to use in the analysis.

Original table structure used to upload the csv.

### 3. Exported Data
The queries above were exported into 4 CSV files for Tableau using the \copy function inside the psql shell.

Example output:  monthly_revenue.csv viewed in LibreOffice

### 4. Tableau Visualizations
The CSVs were imported into Tableau to build interactive charts:

### 5. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Dashboard
Created a dashboard with 6 key KPIs across the top:

Total Revenue, Average Order Size, Average Monthly Revenue, Total Orders, Average Country Revenue (excluding UK), Average Product Revenue

Reference lines were added to highlight averages.

Final Dashboard:

üöÄ Key Insights
Revenue is highly concentrated in the UK, so global averages were recalculated excluding it.

Seasonal patterns appear in monthly revenue trends.

A small number of products drive the majority of sales.
